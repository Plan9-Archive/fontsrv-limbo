first bits work.


# intro

fontsrv is a translation serves for font descriptions to inferno
(sub)font files.  font descriptions contain:  a name, a style
(regular, italic, bold, italic & bold), and a size with optional
size offset.

fontsrv serves the file "fs", typically mounted at /fonts.  a write
to the file sets the request, a read returns the answer.

fontsrv reads a description of available fonts and name aliases.


# install

make sure $ROOT is set.  now "mk install" to compile and install the
files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.
