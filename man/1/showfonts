.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Showfonts
is a simple Tk program that displays fonts.
It has a tk entry for text to display in a font.
Then three fields for selecting the fonts to show display the text in.
Each field can have comma-separated values, they are expanded by showfonts and each combined fontspec is looked up individually and the resulting font displayed.
Hitting return or clicking on the "add" button performs the lookup and displays the fonts.
Clicking on the "name", "style" or "size" buttons presents you with a list of options to choose from, retrieved from the
.LR /mnt/font/list
file.
This does not work when multiple values (comma-separated) are present in an earlier field.
